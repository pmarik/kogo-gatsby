  heading: Reduce Waste
  description: >
    Over 20 million tons of coffee fruit waste in generated each year. If the coffee cherries are left to rot in the fields they can generate more than 15 million tons of CO2e (carbon dioxide equivalent). In addition, there is potential for the coffee fruit to leach dangerous mycotoxins into water ways and the soil.  Upcycling the coffee fruit reduces this impact and improves the environment in a sustainable way.
