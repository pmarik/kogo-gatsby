    We are a green small business that keeps the wellbeing of the world and its inhabitants as its utmost priority. KOGO promotes sustainable development goals by working with small scale farmers, reducing environmental pollution, and upcycling coffee cherries.

    KOGO operates out of Phoenix, Arizona and the founder (a returned Peace Corps
    Volunteer) travels frequently to Panama to survey production, ensure quality, and
    establish meaningful relationships with small scale farmers.
