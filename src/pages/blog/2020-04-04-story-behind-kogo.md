As a child growing up with a mother who was always health conscious I was exposed to a lot of natural remedies and organic food products. Everything from using the gel from an Aloe plant to heal cuts to eating organic cereal that tasted like cardboard.  Early on I began to develop an appreciation for health and wellness and the benefits that stem from being mindful of what you consume and do with your body. I’ve always been interested in increasing the ability of my body and mind with natural products made from the roots and leaves of plants like MACA, MORINGA, and other natural extracts.




During my time in the Peace Corps I was during research on neurotropics trying to find a product that actually did what it claimed to do. I came upon a video of a business owner on a talk show discussing the variety of stimulants that he takes to improve his performance in the work place. He said the words coffee and cherry and immediately my ears perked up. I had just been working with a group of farmers on their coffee production. A few research papers later and I was informed of the amazing variety of benefits to the human body and mind coffee cherries can offer. I quickly tried to find the product online and was met with mixed levels of success. I found one company in Europe that was selling pills using an extract derived from coffee cherries and another that used coffee cherries to make flour.


Coming from a business background an idea started to take hold within me. Not once had I been told by either my Peace Corps trainers or other farmers about the benefits of coffee cherries. After some inquiring I found out that most coffee farmers simply throw away the coffee cherries and a few use the organic matter as fertilizer. I couldn’t believe such potential could go unnoticed. The coffee farmers here are getting paid pennies for their labor while the select few coffee companies hold a monopoly over the market and are raking in profits hand over fist. I realized if I could put together a product to sell to consumers overseas I could help supplement these impoverished farmer’s incomes, reduce environmental pollution that comes from fermented cherry waste, and also offer consumers in the U.S. an extremely valuable product at an affordable price. And so it was that KOGO came to be.
