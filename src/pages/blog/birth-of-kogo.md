I was raised on a sustainable, organic fruit farm in the remote far reaches
of northern Wisconsin. Our family grew apples, raspberries and blueberries
and were taught to value the environment, community and sustainably
produced food.

Growing up, my mother exposed me to a wealth of natural remedies and
organic food products. For example, we would use the gel of an Aloe plant
to heal burns, put chewed up Plantain leaves on bee stings, harvest local
plants to make medicinal teas and tinctures, and we would grow or buy
most of our food from area farms or the local co-op, whose organic cereals
inevitably tasted like cardboard- man I used to dream of having cocoa
puffs!

Cardboard cereal aside, I developed an appreciation for health and
wellness, and the benefits of being mindful of what I consumed. This later
grew into a regular practice of cultivating strength and resilience of body
and mind through fitness and meditation, and through the use of plant-based products like MACA, MORINGA, and other extracts.

So where does Kogo come in? After college and receiving a business
degree, I joined the US Peace Corps in Panama as a Business
Development and Sustainable Agriculture Advisor.

We began service with a 10 week training period; hot, 10-hour days filled
with agricultural training, mosquitos, and the occasional mango.
By the end of the day my mind would be frazzled by the effort of
communicating across language and culture, the hot sun and humidity,
and the constant battle with scorpions and mold that seemed to grow on
everything, including my underwear!

One evening, I was lying under my mosquito net, fan on full blast, using my
phone to do research on nootropics. I was trying to find a nootropic
that actually did what it claimed to do, something that could help me get
through these 10 weeks. Eventually, I came upon a Youtube video of a
CEO being interviewed about the variety of stimulants he takes to improve
his performance in the work place. He said the words “coffee” and “cherry”,
and immediately my ears perked up, for I had just been working with a
group of farmers on their coffee production.

Intrigued, I searched for more information and the research papers I came
across described an amazing variety of benefits that coffee cherries offer to
both the body and mind.

This was all so surprising, because none of my Peace Corps trainers nor
any of the farmers I met talked about the benefits of coffee cherries. After
some inquiring, I discovered that most coffee farmers view coffee cherries
as waste or compost. Often, the cherries are left to rot and ferment in vast
quantities leading to water pollution, and releasing methane gas; therefore,
causing harm to the environment.

In addition, the majority of small scale coffee farmers around the world are
actually paid pennies on the dollar for the product of their labor, while a
few, select, larger coffee companies hold an oligopoly over most of the
market, raking in profits hand over fist.

An idea started to take hold within me. I realized that if I could put together
a product to sell to consumers, it could help supplement farmers’ incomes,
reduce the environmental pollution from fermented cherry waste, and also
offer consumers in the U.S. an extremely valuable product at an affordable
price. And so it was that KOGO came to be, and better yet, it tastes good
and nothing like cardboard!
